# ðŸŒˆ MSA LED Front Piece
A collection of 3D printed files and instruction to build a WLED powered Front Piece replacement for MSA masks.

# ðŸ¤” Too lazy to build yourself?
**I can probably help you out!**

I'll probably open my services every now and then, but do check my Ko-Fi page for more info on price, availability and contact info.

# ðŸ›  How to build?
Please check the [How-To guide](HOWTO.md) on build instructions and bill of materials

# âœ¨ Thanks
This project is based on the work (and might even be compatible with) a different contraption from [Robin](https://rubber.social/@Robin@xantronix.social) used for HexCorp modules, so big thanks to them for letting me use their files as reference âœ¨
